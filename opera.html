            <h6>ACT I</h6>
            <p style="color:green">[Scene.— Tower Green]  When maiden loves, she sits and sighs </p>
            <p style="color:red"> [Enter WILFRED] Mistress Meryll! </p>
            <p><b>PHOEBE</b>  [looking up] Eh! Oh! it's you, is it? You may go 
                               away,if you like. Because I don't want you, you know.
                               <br>
                <b>WILFRED</b>  Haven't you anything to say to me?
                                <br>
                <b>PHOEBE</b>  Oh yes! Are the birds all caged? The wild beasts all
                               littered down? All the locks, chains, bolts, and bars
                               in good order? Is the Little Ease sufficiently
                               comfortable? The racks, pincers, and thumbscrews all
                               ready for work? Ugh! you brute!          
                               <br>
                <b>WILFRED</b> These allusions to my professional duties are in
                               doubtful taste. I didn't become a head-jailer because
                               I like head-jailing. I didn't become an assistant-
                               tormentor because I like assistant-tormenting. We
                               can't all be sorcerers, you know. [PHOEBE is annoyed]
                               Ah! you brought that upon yourself.  
                               <br>
                <b> PHOEBE</b> Colonel Fairfax is not a sorcerer. He's a man of
                               science and an alchemist. 
                               <br>
                <b>WILFRED</b>  Well, whatever he is, he won't be one for long, for
                                he's to be beheaded to-day for dealings with the
                                devil. His master nearly had him last night, when the
                                fire broke out in the Beauchamp [pronounced Bee'cham]
                                Tower.
                                <br>
                 <b>PHOEBE</b> Oh! how I wish he had escaped in the confusion! But
                               take care; there's still time for a reply to his
                               petition for mercy.      
                               <br>
                <b>WILFRED</b> Ah! I'm content to chance that. This evening at half-
                               past seven— ah! [Gesture of chopping off a head.]
